# Quantum-Chip-Design-Aiming-Purcell-Decay-Mitigation
The focus of this project will be on creating a functional quantum chip while addressing challenges like minimizing Purcell decay and improving qubit coherence. The goal is to share the process, including both successes and failures. Tools to be used: Qiskit Metal, Ansys HFSS/COMSOL, QuTiP
