# Quantum-Chip-Design-Aiming-Purcell-Decay-Suppression 
The focus of this project will be on creating a functional quantum chip while addressing the challenge of minimizing Purcell decay. The goal is to share the process, including both successes and failures. Tools to be used: Qiskit Metal, Ansys HFSS/COMSOL, QuTiP
